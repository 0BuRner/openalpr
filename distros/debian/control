Description: Daemon to run OpenALPR in the background
 OpenALPR is an open source Automatic License Plate Recognition library written
 in C++. The library analyzes images and identifies license plates. The output
 is the text representation of any license plate characters found in the image.
 The OpenALPR daemon allows you to monitor a camera stream for license plate
 numbers in the background. Alprd runs as a daemon process on Linux.
 The plate numbers can be streamed to another server (via HTTP posts) or can be
 consumed programmatically via a beanstalkd queue.
